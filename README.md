# Zephyr Integration Utility

## Overview
Zephyr is a testing framework that can be integrated with JIRA. It functions as a comprehensive test repository and execution platform. This utility facilitates the integration of automated test results with Zephyr, leveraging Zephyr APIs for seamless updates.

## Features
- **Test Repository and Execution**: Manage your test cases and execute them within Zephyr.
- **Version and Cycle Management**: Create and manage versions (releases) and cycles (e.g., Chrome, Firefox).
- **Automated Test Results Update**: Automatically update Zephyr with the results of your automated tests.
- **Parallel Processing**: Utilize advanced parallelism concepts for faster results upload.

## Getting Started
### Prerequisites
- JIRA account with Zephyr integration.
- Zephyr API access credentials.

### Installation
1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```sh
   git clone <repository_url>
   ```
2. **Navigate to the project directory:**
   ```sh
   cd <project_directory>
   ```
3. **Configure your Zephyr details:**
   Update the configuration file with your Zephyr API details, project, version, and cycle information.

### Usage
1. **Create Project, Version, and Cycle:**
   Use the utility to set up your project, version (release), and cycles within Zephyr.
2. **Tag Test Cases:**
   Tag the test cases within each cycle. The utility will note these IDs.
3. **Execute Automated Tests:**
   Run your automated tests.
4. **Update Zephyr with Test Results:**
   Use the utility to update Zephyr with the test results, either after each test run or in bulk.

## Configuration
The configuration file (`config.yaml`) should include:
- Zephyr API URL
- Project ID
- Version ID
- Cycle IDs
- Authentication details (username, password/API key)

## Key Concepts
- **Version (Release)**: Represents a specific release or iteration of your project.
- **Cycle**: Represents different test environments or configurations (e.g., Chrome, Firefox).
- **Test Case ID**: Unique identifier for each test case in Zephyr.

## Performance
The utility employs parallel processing to ensure that test results are uploaded efficiently, minimizing the time required for updates.
